## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first time coding a webpage with Sass using BEM. The setup in the beginning took longer than just writing plain CSS, but worth the time. Once the partials are in place, coding boilerplate was like with CSS but so much more organized. Wish I could've spent more time in planning and deciding the layout for elemnts, like choosing between Grid and flexbox. This should improve the readibility of my program.

### Useful resources

- (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfMHA8SqUL4&t=6953s) - Jessica Chan's Sass tutorial definitly taught me a alot about Sass and how to code responsively in genral.

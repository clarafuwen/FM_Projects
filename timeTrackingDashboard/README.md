## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass/SCSS

### What I learned

It seems this is the perfect project to practice CSS Grid and Sass/SCSS. The heavylifting is done by individual components, therefore, the boilerplate.scss is super light-weighted. I also find it easy to modify the values of parameters since most of them are grouped in their specific parttials...

### Useful resources

-(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfMHA8SqUL4&t=6953s) - Jessica Chan's Sass tutorial definitly taught me a alot about Sass and how to code responsively in general.

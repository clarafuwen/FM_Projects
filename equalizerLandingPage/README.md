## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

The way I did this project was basically positioning elements relative or absolute to their parent elements. It was a fun practice of mixing static box and flexbox. Definetely learnt a lot about about this very basic thus powerful property.

## Acknowledgments

I had trouble setting up the exact CSS filter configurations to change the svg image color when hover on icons. Got inspirations from @mendoncajoao from Frontend Mentor who has completed the challenge.

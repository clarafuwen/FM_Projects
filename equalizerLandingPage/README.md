## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

The way I did this project was basically positioning elements relative or absolute to their parent elements. It was a fun experience of mixing static box and flexbox. Definitely learnt a lot about 'position' property.

## Acknowledgments

I had trouble setting up the exact CSS filter configurations to change the svg image color when hover on icons. Got inspirations from @mendoncajoao from Frontend Mentor who has completed the challenge.
